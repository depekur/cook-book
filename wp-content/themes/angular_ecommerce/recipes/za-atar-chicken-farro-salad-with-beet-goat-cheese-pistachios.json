Seasoned with za&rsquo;atar&mdash;a traditional Middle Eastern spice blend of oregano, sesame seeds and sumac&mdash;the pan-seared chicken is lightly smoky, crispy and succulent. For extra heartiness, we&rsquo;re serving it over nutty farro mixed with mildly bitter arugula. Lastly, we&rsquo;re garnishing the dish with the goat cheese and beet (marinated with red wine vinegar and shallot), along with a second classic pairing: fresh mint and earthy pistachios.
