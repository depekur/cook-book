In Mexico, the word has come to refer to a special kind of sandwich served on a roll stuffed with any number of savory fillings. In this dish, we&rsquo;re filling the sandwiches with traditionally-spiced chicken, avocado, tomato, marinated onion, cilantro and queso fresco. On the side, we&rsquo;re serving up a tasty salad featuring summer cucumber. Depending on what&rsquo;s best in your area, the summer cucumber you receive may look different from what&rsquo;s pictured. But don&rsquo;t worry: just  use it exactly as instructed!
