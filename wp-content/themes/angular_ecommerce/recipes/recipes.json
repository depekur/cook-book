Instead of water, the eggs are poached in a flavorful sauce, usually comprised of tomatoes and peppers&mdash;both of which are at the height of ripeness in late summer. In this recipe, we&rsquo;re simmering the vegetables, then poaching the eggs by baking the dish, resulting in the perfect consistency. In step 6, if you don&rsquo;t have an oven-safe pan, don&rsquo;t worry! Simply transfer the mixture to a baking dish before cracking the eggs into the sauce.

Dark brown flecks appear as the butter foams and becomes fragrant in the pan. Once this happens, the butter is ready. (Be careful not to overcook it! Adding the shallot and corn will stop the browning process.)
