Our version showcases juicy cherry tomatoes, and uses green bell pepper instead, for delicious variation. Verjus rouge, the juice of tart red grapes, gives the sauce an extra lift. And we&rsquo;re adding sweet, chewy golden raisins and pleasantly bitter rainbow chard to the mix to complete the flavor profile. The result, stirred into the fregola sarda pasta (a small Sardinian variety), is vivid and complex&mdash;the perfect side for crispy catfish.
