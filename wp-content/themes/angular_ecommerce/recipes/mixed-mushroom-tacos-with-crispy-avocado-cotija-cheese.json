Flavored with authentic Mexican spices, they&rsquo;re hearty and incredibly delicious. Here, we&rsquo;re using two types of mushrooms&mdash;button-topped cremini and ruffled maitake&mdash;and pairing them with an array of tasty toppings. Quick-pickled red onion provides tangy brightness, while battered, pan-fried avocado slices add crispy texture on the outside and creaminess within. When frying the avocado, be sure to work in batches, to keep the oil in the pan nice and hot. Enjoy, chefs!
