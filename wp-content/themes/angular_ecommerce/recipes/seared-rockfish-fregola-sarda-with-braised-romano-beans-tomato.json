Braising&mdash;or cooking ingredients in oil, then simmering them in a flavorful liquid&mdash;is an incredibly delicious cooking technique. As they simmer, the ingredients break down and start to combine, resulting in unique texture and flavor. Here, we&rsquo;re applying the technique to seasonal green beans and tomato simmered in a sauce of red wine vinegar, olives and spices. The result, served over a bed of fregola sarda pasta, is a perfect, light summer dinner.
