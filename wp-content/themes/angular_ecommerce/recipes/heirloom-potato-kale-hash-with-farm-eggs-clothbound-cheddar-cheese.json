Here, we&rsquo;re cooking some of autumn&rsquo;s first fingerling potatoes and kale with late-summer sweet peppers, then topping the dish with eggs and aged cheddar before finishing it in the oven. One quick note: the pan we&rsquo;re picturing here is a skillet, but any oven-safe pan will work just as well. If you don&rsquo;t have an oven-safe pan, don&rsquo;t worry! Simply transfer the hash to a baking dish before you begin step 5.
