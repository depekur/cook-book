We&rsquo;re finishing our stir-fry with a sauce of savory-sweet soy glaze and tart rice vinegar. The sauce lightly coats the vegetables&mdash;green beans and bok choy, a type of Chinese cabbage&mdash;as well as juicy beef and udon noodles. A Japanese addition, these noodles are exceptionally chewy and thick. They&rsquo;re a delicious contrast to the crisp vegetables and crunchy peanuts on top.
