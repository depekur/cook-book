In this recipe, we&rsquo;re making the dish deliciously seasonal by finishing the paprika-spiced shrimp in a saut&eacute; of summer vegetables, which reduces to create a tasty sauce. The mixture is perfect served right atop the grits, which we&rsquo;re cooking with sweet corn kernels and lemon zest, for amazing texture and brightness.
