We&rsquo;re combining delightfully ruffled campanelle pasta (whose name means &ldquo;little bells&rdquo; in Italian) with roasted broccoli, which browns and turns lightly crunchy in the oven. Then we&rsquo;re mixing in sliced almonds, Parmesan cheese and lemon-herb butter. Lemon juice, chopped mint and parsley (along with garlic paste) add incredible, fresh flavor to the softened butter, which we&rsquo;re also spooning on top as a garnish.
