They&rsquo;re most popular in Colombia and Venezuela, where arepas have been part of the region&rsquo;s cuisine for centuries. The word &ldquo;arepa&rdquo; comes from a local indigenous language and means, roughly, &ldquo;cornbread.&rdquo; These moist cakes with crispy crusts are traditionally sliced and stuffed. In our version, you&rsquo;ll fill them with saut&eacute;ed bell and poblano peppers, seared queso para fre&iacute;r (a delicious semi-hard cheese) and the intensely flavorful herb sauce chimichurri. You&rsquo;ll also serve them with a tasty, hearty salad of kale, avocado and almonds.
