Yakibuta (Japanese for &ldquo;roast pork&rdquo;) is a classic preparation similar to char siu, a Cantonese-style Chinese dish. The pork is seared and roasted, then sliced thinly and used in all kinds of dishes&mdash;accenting the ingredients around it with its signature richness. Here, we&rsquo;re serving it with tender ramen noodles, a flavorful broth and seasonal produce, including eggplant and delicate microgreens (the nutritious early sprouts of leafy vegetables).
