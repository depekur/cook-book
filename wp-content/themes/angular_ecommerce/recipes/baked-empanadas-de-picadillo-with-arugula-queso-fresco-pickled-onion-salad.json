From the Spanish word for wrapping an ingredient in bread, the empanada is a savory turnover particularly popular in the Eastern Mexican state of Hidalgo. Our baked empanadas &ldquo;de picadillo&rdquo; are savory-sweet, stuffed with a complex filling of ground beef, tomato sauce, apricots, almonds and spices. (A reference to the filling, &ldquo;de picadillo&rdquo; means &ldquo;minced.&rdquo;) We&rsquo;re pairing them with a zesty, creamy dipping sauce and an arugula salad tossed with crumbly queso fresco and quick-pickled onion.
