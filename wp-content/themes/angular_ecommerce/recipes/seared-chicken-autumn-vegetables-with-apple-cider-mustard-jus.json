We&rsquo;re searing chicken thighs and saut&eacute;ing creamy purple top turnip and tender cabbage. Then we&rsquo;re finishing them in a light pan sauce&mdash;or &ldquo;jus&rdquo;&mdash;made with dried figs, sharp whole grain mustard, thyme and tart apple cider. The key to beautifully crisp chicken is drying your chicken thoroughly, using a hot pan and letting the skin get browned and crispy before flipping. This way, all of the incredibly flavorful fond (the browned bits) left behind can be used to coat the vegetables and make the delicious pan sauce.
