A combination of sweet corn, hearty summer beans and tomato, it&rsquo;s prized for its simple, delicious flavors. In our version, we&rsquo;re topping the succotash with flaky, pan-seared cod fillets and a uniquely tasty delicacy: pickled grapes. Tart and sweet in equal measure, the pickled grapes make an incredibly delicious topping for the mild, tender cod. And we&rsquo;re garnishing the dish with piquant chives to complete the flavor profile.
