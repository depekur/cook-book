Families gather to enjoy the delicious bounty of shellfish and hearty vegetables, typically boiled all together. In this inspired recipe, to build their individual flavors, we&rsquo;re boiling our potatoes separately from our corn on the cob. Then we&rsquo;re finishing them together&mdash;along with seasoned shrimp, lemon juice and butter&mdash;in one big pan. (If your pan isn&rsquo;t big enough, feel free to use a pot!) A condiment of creamy aioli completes this late-summer feast.
