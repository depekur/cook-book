A smaller, sweeter cousin of butternut squash, honeynut is delicious sprinkled with sumac, a versatile spice from the Middle East that adds vivid color and a tangy, lemony flavor. Served with pickled onion and a salad made from savory feta cheese, juicy apple and hearty walnuts, this is a bright and flavorful dinner that showcases fall&rsquo;s best produce. (For the perfect, juicy medium-rare steaks, be sure to flip the steaks only once, and to cook them just until pink in the center.)
