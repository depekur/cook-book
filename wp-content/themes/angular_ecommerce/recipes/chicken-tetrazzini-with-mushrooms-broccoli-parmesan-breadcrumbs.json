An American dish, tetrazzini was named for a famous Italian opera singer who frequented the hotel restaurant where it was invented. In this recipe, we&rsquo;re adding broccoli (quickly boiled alongside egg noodles, our pasta of choice), and swapping out cream for milk to lighten the sauce a bit. Finally, we&rsquo;re mixing Parmesan cheese and a little olive oil into the panko breadcrumbs for the toasty crust, topping off the casserole with extra savory flavor.
