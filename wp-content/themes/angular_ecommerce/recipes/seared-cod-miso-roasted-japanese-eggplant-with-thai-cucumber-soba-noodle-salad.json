Cucumber, a crunchy, cooling vegetable that swells on a flowering vine, is originally from South Asia. So is the eggplant&mdash;large, hearty and incredible at absorbing sauces. To take advantage of these unique properties, we&rsquo;re serving the cucumber raw in a soba noodle salad flavored with anise-like Thai basil, and we&rsquo;re roasting the eggplant in a uniquely flavorful sauce of sesame oil, mirin and white miso.
