In this recipe, we&rsquo;re taking that experience (sides and all) and adding special, seasonal flare. You&rsquo;ll serve juicy bavette steaks with roasted potatoes and a summery saut&eacute; of toasted garlic, tomato and long beans. Though they may look ungainly, these long, tropical beans are wonderfully tender and flavorful. Like most things, we think they&rsquo;re best served alongside a tasty, juicy steak.
