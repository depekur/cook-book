That&rsquo;s the chickpea, subtle in flavor and creamy in texture. Our take on chana masala combines chickpeas, spinach and pea shoots in a well-balanced broth of potent spices and tart tomato. What&rsquo;s more, we&rsquo;re serving our curry under pan-fried catfish fillets, spiced and dredged (for a deliciously crispy touch) in chickpea flour. Brown rice and a cilantro garnish round out this satisfying meal.
