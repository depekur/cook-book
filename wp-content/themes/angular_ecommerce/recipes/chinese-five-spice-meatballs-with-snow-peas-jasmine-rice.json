Some recipes date all the way back to the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd Century BCE. They&rsquo;re usually made with flour, which acts as a binding agent, helping the meatballs to hold their shape. We&rsquo;re swapping in crispy panko breadcrumbs instead (for added texture), and we&rsquo;re flavoring the meat with five-spice powder and traditional aromatics before coating it in a sweet and savory duet of sauces. Lastly, for an herbaceous touch and a subtle crunch, we&rsquo;re garnishing the finished meatballs with cilantro, sesame seeds and scallions.
