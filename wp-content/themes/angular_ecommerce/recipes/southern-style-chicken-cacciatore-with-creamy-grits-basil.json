Matt&rsquo;s cuisine is rooted in local food communities. He relies on farmers and artisans he trusts, and on the natural flavors of his ingredients. His take on farm-to-table cooking celebrates new flavor combinations without forgetting the classics, as in this Southern spin on an Italian favorite.
