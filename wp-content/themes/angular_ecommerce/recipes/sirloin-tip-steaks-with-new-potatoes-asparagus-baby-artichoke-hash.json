Traditionally, potatoes are the stars of the dish&mdash;beautifully crisped and browned to savory perfection. And in spring, there&rsquo;s a special kind of potato available, which we&rsquo;re using to make this hash unique. While they&rsquo;re not a separate variety, new potatoes (potatoes harvested while they&rsquo;re still young) are incredibly delicious. With other spring vegetables like radish and asparagus, juicy slices of sirloin and an Italian salsa verde, this is a new, gourmet spin on one of our favorite meals.
