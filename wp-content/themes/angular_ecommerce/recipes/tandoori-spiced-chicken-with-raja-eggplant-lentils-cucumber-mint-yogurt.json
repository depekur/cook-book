Tandoori chicken is a popular Indian dish, in which chicken is typically marinated in yogurt and coated in masala (a classic Indian spice mix). Here, we&rsquo;re turning the yogurt into a sauce by combining it with mint and grated Persian cucumber. And we&rsquo;re searing the coated chicken to lightly char the spices, bringing out their complex flavors. As a hearty, creamy side, we&rsquo;re making green lentils, mixed with a second blend of spices and simmered with onion and heirloom eggplant. (Depending on what&rsquo;s best in your area, your eggplant may be either slender and purple or round and white.)
