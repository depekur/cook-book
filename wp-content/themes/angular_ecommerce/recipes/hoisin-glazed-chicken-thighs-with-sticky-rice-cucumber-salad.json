Thanks to its particular starches, this special, short-grain variety cooks up with a lightly sticky texture, making it delightful to eat on its own&mdash;or with delicious sauces. Here, we&rsquo;re simmering our sticky rice with garlic and ginger, then sprinkling peanuts and aromatic Thai basil on top. And we&rsquo;re serving it alongside chicken thighs, pan-seared and glazed with another traditional ingredient: savory-sweet hoisin sauce. A cooling, crunchy salad of marinated cucumber and onion completes this flavorful dish.
