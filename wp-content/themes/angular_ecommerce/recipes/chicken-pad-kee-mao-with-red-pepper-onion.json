Though the origin of the name is contested, one theory states that the noodles were typically paired with rice wine in local restaurants. A stir-fry of vegetables, a spicy, savory sauce and broad, tender rice noodles, it&rsquo;s hearty and deliciously textured. In our version, we&rsquo;re poaching chicken, then shredding it before finishing it in the stir-fry with the noodles and sauce. And to complete the dish&rsquo;s flavor profile, we&rsquo;re drizzling fresh lime juice over top, and garnishing the pad kee mao with anise-like Thai basil.
