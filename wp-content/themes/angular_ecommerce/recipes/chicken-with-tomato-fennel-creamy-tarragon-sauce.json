Both of these aromatic vegetables are naturally sweet, and when cooked slowly (with frequent stirring, to prevent burning), their sugars caramelize, or turn richly flavorful and brown. We&rsquo;re using this mixture as the base of the sauce, made with sherry vinegar and a little butter. Topped with roasted, thyme-infused cherry tomatoes and served over jasmine rice, this meal brings fine dining right into your kitchen.
