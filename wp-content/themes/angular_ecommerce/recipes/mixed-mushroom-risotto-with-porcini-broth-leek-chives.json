Here, we&rsquo;re using four unique varieties that add tremendous, woodsy complexity to our creamy, Parmesan-laden risotto: ruffled maitake, meaty oyster, mild cremini and the highly prized dried porcini. The drying process enhances the flavor of the porcini, making it intense, concentrated and perfect for infusing the dish with deep umami notes. To make the broth for the risotto, we&rsquo;re cooking leek with thyme and garlic, then adding both the porcini and the enriched water used to rehydrate them.
