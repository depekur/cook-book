Coating the pork chops in breadcrumbs adds incredible textural contrast. (The breading crisps up in the pan, turning a toasty golden brown.) But it also helps to seal in the rich juices of the chops, resulting in unbeatable succulence. On the side, we&rsquo;re serving a cooling, creamy, garlic-lemon aioli to spoon over top. The result is a uniquely delicious take on the traditional pork chop dinner.
