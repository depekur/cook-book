Vadouvan curry powder, a French spice inspired by Indian masala, is full of powerful, savory flavor. We&rsquo;re using it here to season patties featuring lamb (a meat popular in Indian cuisine) and pairing the burgers with lightly fried, vadouvan-spiced zucchini rounds. And to perfectly balance the dish, we&rsquo;re topping the burgers with a creamy yogurt sauce, which also makes the perfect crispy zucchini dip.
