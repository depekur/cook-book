But &ldquo;bulgogi&rdquo; has come to describe&mdash;more generally&mdash;those authentic, delicious flavors. Here, in our stovetop recipe, we&rsquo;re cooking lamb and beef in a complex, rich sauce of deeply savory soy glaze, subtly nutty sesame oil and gochujang (a spicy-sweet chile paste). And we&rsquo;re adding seasonal, crisp long beans to the mix, as well as a side of aromatic sticky rice.
