In this recipe, we&rsquo;re making gourmet ciabatta, eggplant and mozzarella paninis on the stove, using a heavy pot to press them down and create their distinctive, crispy texture. On the side, we&rsquo;re serving a classic tomato sauce, along with an incredibly tasty treat: a salad of arugula and caramelized stone fruit. (Depending on what&rsquo;s best in your area, we&rsquo;ll be sending you either a plum or a pluot.) When heated, the stone fruit&rsquo;s natural sugars caramelize and brown, resulting in rich, complex sweetness&mdash;the perfect pairing for the hearty, melty sandwiches.
