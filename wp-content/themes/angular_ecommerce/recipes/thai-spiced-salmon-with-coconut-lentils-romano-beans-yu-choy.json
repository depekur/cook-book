This Thai-inspired dish offers a somewhat different, seasonal way to enjoy the legumes&mdash;with the same traditional flavors. We&rsquo;re combining French green lentils (an exceptionally fine, earthy variety that remains intact during cooking) with curry-spiced, summery Romano beans and yu choy, a mustard relative popular in Southeast Asian cooking. Finished with a light coconut-lime dressing and garnished with Thai basil, this cooling salad elegantly completes delicious, seared salmon fillets.
