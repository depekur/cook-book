We&rsquo;re pan-frying catfish, a Southern staple, and serving it over &ldquo;dirty rice,&rdquo; or brown rice simmered with traditional Cajun spices, onion, celery and green bell pepper. To spoon over the crispy fillets, we&rsquo;re making zesty, creamy remoulade. Originally a French sauce, remoulade is incredibly popular in the region. For a little extra heat, we&rsquo;re infusing ours with Tabasco.
