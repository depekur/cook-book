Long, thick and deliciously chewy, udon noodles are most often served in a hot broth. But brothless yaki udon is also a popular preparation, and we&rsquo;re taking inspiration from it here. A stir-fry of vegetables, noodles and sauce, yaki udon is a little cooler&mdash;perfect for the late spring weather.
