The cooked mushrooms and lentils form a thick batter with egg and chickpea flour, made simply from ground chickpeas. In a hot pan, that batter sets into delicious burgers, turning crispy and brown on the outside. Topped with aioli, arugula and lemon-marinated red onion, these burgers are gourmet through and through.
