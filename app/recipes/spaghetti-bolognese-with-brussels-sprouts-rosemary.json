But why stop there, when a wealth of incredible fall produce is just getting into full swing? In this recipe, we&rsquo;re serving up classic spaghetti bolognese with a special, simple touch: Brussels sprouts. To use them as leafy greens, just pick the leaves off the cores, trimming more from the bottom of each sprout as necessary.
