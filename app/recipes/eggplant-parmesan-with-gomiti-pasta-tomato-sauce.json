An Italian classic, it consists of eggplant slices fried lightly in a pan, then baked under layers of savory tomato sauce and cheeses (mild mozzarella and sharp Parmesan). It&rsquo;s rich with traditional flavors, as well as varying textures&mdash;including, here, the delicious crispiness of panko breadcrumbs. On the side, we&rsquo;re serving whole grain gomiti pasta (better known as &ldquo;elbows&rdquo;). And we&rsquo;re garnishing the dish with potent, fresh oregano leaves.
