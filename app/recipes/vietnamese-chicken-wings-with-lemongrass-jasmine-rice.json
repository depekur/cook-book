In the original recipe, the wings were deep fried and coated in a cayenne hot sauce. But today, there are hundreds of different takes on the classic. Our version features a tart sauce inspired by the cuisine of Vietnam, and for a lighter touch, we&rsquo;re roasting the wings instead of frying them.
