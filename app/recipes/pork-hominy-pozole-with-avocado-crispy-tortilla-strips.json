Hominy is maize treated with natural minerals in a process that unlocks its flavors and puffs it up to several times its original size. When simmered in the broth for pozole, it&rsquo;s incredibly tender and delicious. We&rsquo;re serving our version of the soup with an array of toppings, so you can customize it yourself: crunchy, homemade tortilla strips, lime, creamy avocado and crumbly queso fresco (a Mexican favorite).
