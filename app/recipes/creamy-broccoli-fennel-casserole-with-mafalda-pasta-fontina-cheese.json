It&rsquo;s among a small group of pastas that were dedicated to the House of Savoy when the family became the ruling monarchs of Italy at the turn of the 20th Century. Also called reginette, or &ldquo;little queens,&rdquo; mafalda is named for Princess Mafalda&mdash;and its crinkled edges make it the perfect choice for clinging onto the rich Fontina cheese and b&eacute;chamel sauce we&rsquo;re using in this casserole. Cooked with one of our favorite fall aromatics, fennel, this dish is a warming, gourmet spin on Italian comfort food.
