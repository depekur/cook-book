Tiny heads of densely wrapped leaves, Brussels sprouts are amazingly versatile. Here, we&rsquo;re thinly slicing them, cooking them with a little lemon zest and mixing them into a farro salad that accompanies seared salmon fillets. In the salad, we&rsquo;re also featuring apple, one of our favorite fall fruits. Juicy and sweet, it&rsquo;s delicious coated in a tangy vinaigrette made with lemon juice and Dijon mustard.
