It&rsquo;s made by simmering rice with ingredients like spices and aromatics (typically onion, celery and bell pepper), which deliciously infuse it and alter its color. In our Cajun-inspired version, we&rsquo;re adding tofu and okra. Though it&rsquo;s often used as a thickener to add body to jambalayas and stews, okra is amazingly versatile. Here, we&rsquo;re tossing it with rice flour, which clings to it, creating a natural batter. Quickly pan-frying the okra toasts the flour&mdash;adding crispy texture and authentic flavor to this classic.
