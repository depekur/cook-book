(Depending on what&rsquo;s best near you, you&rsquo;ll receive either a red or a green pear.) Velvety sage leaves layered into the sandwiches create the perfect savory bite. On the side, a salad of peppery arugula, tender Brussels sprouts and crunchy hazelnuts strikes an ideal balance with the crispy grilled cheese. All together, it&rsquo;s an easy-to-prepare celebration of the flavors of autumn that&rsquo;s as comforting as it is gourmet.
