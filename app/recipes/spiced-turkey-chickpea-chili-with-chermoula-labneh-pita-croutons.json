Here, we&rsquo;re using it to top a hearty turkey chili made with chickpeas and eggplant. The cilantro, garlic, lemon and olive oil perfectly complement the warming spices of ras el hanout, regarded as Morocco&rsquo;s &ldquo;national spice blend&rdquo; and one of the cuisine&rsquo;s fundamental ingredients. For crunchy texture and added creaminess, we&rsquo;re also topping the chili with pan-toasted pita croutons and tangy labneh (a Middle Eastern cheese made from strained yogurt).
