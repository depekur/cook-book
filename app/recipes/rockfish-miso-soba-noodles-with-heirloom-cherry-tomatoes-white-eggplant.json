Let&rsquo;s celebrate this mild, hearty produce. For this Japanese-inspired recipe, depending on what&rsquo;s freshest near you, we&rsquo;ll be sending you either a purple eggplant or a delicate white eggplant. To bring out the fruit&rsquo;s subtle, savory flavor, we&rsquo;re saut&eacute;ing it, then serving it in a cooling soba noodle salad&mdash;along with multicolored cherry tomatoes&mdash;as a side for pan-seared cod. And for crunchy texture and an intensely aromatic finish, we&rsquo;re garnishing the dish with peanuts and Thai basil.
