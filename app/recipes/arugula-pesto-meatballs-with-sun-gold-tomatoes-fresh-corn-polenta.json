Our sauce gets its bright-green color (and flavor) not only from basil, but also from peppery arugula&mdash;combined with earthy walnuts, Parmesan and garlic. We&rsquo;re serving the pesto meatballs on top of creamy polenta, simmered with fresh corn kernels to accent the sweetness of the cornmeal. And for another topping, we&rsquo;re marinating sun gold tomatoes with basil and olive oil. The marinade softens the tomatoes slightly and draws out their tropically-sweet juices, providing an exquisite pairing for the savory meatballs.
