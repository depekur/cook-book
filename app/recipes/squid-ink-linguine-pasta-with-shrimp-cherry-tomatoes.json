To make it, squid ink is mixed right into fresh pasta dough, turning it a gorgeous, dark hue and infusing it with a light salinity that pairs perfectly with shellfish. Here, we&rsquo;re using a classic Italian sauce of fresh cherry tomatoes, spiced with a little red pepper and enriched with lobster demi-glace.
