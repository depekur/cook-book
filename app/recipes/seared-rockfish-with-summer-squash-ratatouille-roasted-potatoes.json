A traditional vegetable stew hailing from France, it showcases summer squash (you may receive slightly varying kinds, depending on what&rsquo;s freshest near you), eggplant, tomatoes and more. The key to building its classic flavor profile is browning the vegetables individually before simmering them together. This enhances the distinct, mild flavors of the squash and eggplant, developing them separately so that each shines through the fresh, tart-sweet tomato sauce.
