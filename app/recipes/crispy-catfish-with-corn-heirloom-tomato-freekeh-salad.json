Both at the peak of ripeness late in the season, corn and cherry tomatoes are a natural and delicious pairing. Here, we&rsquo;re only cooking them briefly, to maintain the corn&rsquo;s tender, crunchy sweetness and to slightly soften the cherry tomatoes, preserving their juiciness and slightly tart acidity. The result is a gorgeous, balanced side that perfectly complements the flaky catfish and nutty freekeh. And we&rsquo;re garnishing the dish with marjoram, a savory herb popular in the Mediterranean.
