Within these pork patties are fresh ginger, nutty sesame oil and hoisin sauce (a favorite in Chinese cooking, similar in flavor to American barbecue sauce). We&rsquo;re topping the burgers with seasonal, juicy tomato and cilantro. And as a condiment, we&rsquo;re combining mayo with a little more hoisin, cutting the mayo&rsquo;s savory richness with tangy-sweet notes. A salad of lightly-marinated cucumber and red onion completes the dish with refreshing flavor&mdash;and plenty of crunch.
