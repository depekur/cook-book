Here, we&rsquo;re simply using a heavy pot to press our pan-toasted tortas&mdash;filled with spiced chicken, avocado, tomato and queso fresco (a crumbly Mexican cheese). On the side, we&rsquo;re serving a refreshing romaine salad with a bit of a kick to it, thanks to the chile powder and cumin in the sour cream-lime juice dressing.
