The pressure ensures uniquely crispy-skinned and succulent results. Here, we&rsquo;re swapping out the brick for a large pot&mdash;and using the technique to blacken our chicken. The spices on the chicken&rsquo;s skin &ldquo;blacken&rdquo; (or char) up against the hot pan, deepening in delicious flavor. On the side, we&rsquo;re serving a summer vegetable saut&eacute; and tomato rice, made by simmering jasmine rice with savory tomato and aromatics. The grains plump up with vibrant flavor and color alike.
