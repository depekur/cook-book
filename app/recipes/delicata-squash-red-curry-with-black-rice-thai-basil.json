We love the rich flavor and smooth texture of delicata, and we love that&mdash;thanks to its thin skin&mdash;there&rsquo;s no need to peel it before cooking. We&rsquo;re roasting the squash first to brown it, then we&rsquo;re simmering it with mustard greens in a broth of red curry paste and coconut milk. Served with black rice, a purplish variety with an almost fruity flavor, this warming, Thai-inspired meal is perfect for the autumn weather.
