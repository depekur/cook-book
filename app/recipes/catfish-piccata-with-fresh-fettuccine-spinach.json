Here, we&rsquo;re making catfish piccata by mixing the bright, briny sauce into a bed of fresh fettuccine and spinach, then serving the flaky catfish fillets on top. Rosemary, crushed red pepper flakes and a little verjus blanc (or the juice of tart white grapes) add herbaceous heat and gourmet complexity to the dish.
