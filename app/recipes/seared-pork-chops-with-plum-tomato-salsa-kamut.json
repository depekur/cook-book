It was brought to the U.S. from Egypt in the late 1940s and planted in Montana. After falling into and out of obscurity, the grain was rediscovered in the 1970s. It has increased in popularity ever since, with a new generation of chefs prizing it as a gourmet specialty ingredient. Here, we&rsquo;re mixing kamut with spinach and corn and serving it alongside crispy pork chops. And we&rsquo;re topping the dish with a rich balsamic pan sauce and a sweet-and-savory salsa made with cherry tomatoes and stone fruit. (Depending on what&rsquo;s freshest near you, you&rsquo;ll receive either a delicious plum or a pluot.)
