The tart bite of the citrus cuts the mild richness of the cheese, making for a delicious pairing. In this recipe, we&rsquo;re using lemon ricotta to flavor fresh linguine, coated in a simple sauce of lemon-infused oil. We&rsquo;re also roasting some of the season&rsquo;s first fennel and adding it to the mix (along with olives and fennel fronds) for browned, crispy texture and incredible flavor. And for a final, gourmet touch, we&rsquo;re toasting breadcrumbs with shallot, garlic, parsley and butter, and sprinkling them over the dish as a garnish.
