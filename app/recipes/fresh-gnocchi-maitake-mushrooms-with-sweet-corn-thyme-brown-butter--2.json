Browning butter is a simple process with amazing results. It consists of toasting the butter to release its deep, nutty flavor. Dark brown flecks appear as the butter foams and becomes fragrant in the pan. Once this happens, the butter is ready. (Be careful not to overcook it! Adding the shallot and corn will stop the browning process.) You&rsquo;ll finish the gnocchi in the sauce of browned butter, delicate maitake mushrooms, corn and savory thyme&mdash;coating the dumplings&rsquo; tender surface.
