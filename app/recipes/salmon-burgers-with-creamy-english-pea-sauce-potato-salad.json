In this recipe for wholesome salmon burgers, you&rsquo;ll roast a salmon fillet, mix it with breadcrumbs and aromatics then sear the patties on the stove. We&rsquo;re also topping them with a unique take on classic tartar sauce (a mayonnaise-based condiment usually served with seafood). Instead of mayo, we&rsquo;re using cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che as the base and adding shallot, mint and lemon juice to give these burgers a zesty kick.
