We&rsquo;re making our sesame chicken stir-fry with an authentic, flavorful sauce of sesame oil, rice vinegar and soy glaze. And for a unique addition, we&rsquo;re serving it with Japanese soba (or buckwheat) noodles, which are wonderfully nutty in flavor. For seasonal flair, we&rsquo;re also mixing in cauliflower&mdash;a vegetable with deep roots in Asian cuisines. Its deliciously earthy flavor elevates the dish to new heights.
