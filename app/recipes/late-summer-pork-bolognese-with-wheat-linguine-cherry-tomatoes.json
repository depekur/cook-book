It&rsquo;s traditionally made with a trio of aromatic vegetables called &ldquo;soffrito&rdquo;: onion, celery and carrot (a cool-weather vegetable that begins our transition toward early fall). Saut&eacute;ed together, they provide an exceptional base of flavor. To brighten our delicious pork bolognese, we&rsquo;re using juicy cherry tomatoes. And we&rsquo;re finishing the whole grain linguine in the sauce, then topping the dish with sharp Parmesan and fresh parsley.
