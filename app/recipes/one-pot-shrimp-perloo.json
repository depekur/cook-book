Similar to jambalaya, perloo starts with a flavorful base of rice simmered with tomato, bell pepper, celery, garlic and onion. We&rsquo;re making ours with hearty, absorbent bomba rice&mdash;a Spanish variety traditionally used for paella&mdash;and cooking it risotto-style before stirring in the shrimp right at the end. The heat of the perloo will cook the shrimp, even without a flame, for the perfect, crisp texture. Enjoy, chefs!
