In Sardinian hands, the couscous of North Africa likely became fregola sarda, a miniature pasta made by rubbing semolina flour with water until beads form. The pasta is slow-dried, then toasted, giving it varying brown hues and bringing out its nutty flavor. Here, we&rsquo;re featuring it in a Mediterranean-inspired bake (or casserole). After tossing the pasta with mozzarella, aromatics, lemon juice and fresh oregano, we&rsquo;re topping it with sliced late-summer vegetables, breadcrumbs and Parmesan, then crisping the dish up in the oven.
