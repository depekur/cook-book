Couscous is made from semolina wheat, ground coarsely and rolled into grain-sized balls. To take advantage of its incredible absorbency, we&rsquo;re cooking ours with cardamom, turmeric, sumac and more. The couscous soaks up the authentic flavors from the boiling water&mdash;and plumps up to a delightful fluffiness. For added complexity, we&rsquo;re mixing in almonds, carrots and dates (the uniquely sweet fruits of a palm tree).
