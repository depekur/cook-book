Once cooked, it can be pulled apart into delicately sweet, spaghetti-like strands. The thin golden &ldquo;noodles&rdquo; (you can even twirl them with a fork!) have a tender bite. They make a light base for a flavorful sauce of bright tomatoes, briny Cerignola olives, cremini mushrooms and nutty Parmesan. The result is a delicious, seasonal twist on the classic spaghetti and marinara.
