First, instead of lettuce, simply-dressed collard greens give the burgers a mildly peppery kick. Next, in lieu of the classic condiments, you&rsquo;ll make chow chow&mdash;a slightly vinegary relish&mdash;featuring aromatics and green tomato. Green tomato is the delicious result of harvesting a red tomato early. It has a firm texture that&rsquo;s ideal for stewing, and its tartness perfectly cuts the richness of the burgers. Served with Old Bay-spiced oven fries, this meal is a uniquely Southern twist on an all-American classic.
