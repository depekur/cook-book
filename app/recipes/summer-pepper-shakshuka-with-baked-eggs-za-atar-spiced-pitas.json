Instead of water, the eggs are poached in a flavorful sauce, usually comprised of tomatoes and peppers&mdash;both of which are at the height of ripeness in late summer. In this recipe, we&rsquo;re simmering the vegetables, then poaching the eggs by baking the dish, resulting in the perfect consistency. In step 6, if you don&rsquo;t have an oven-safe pan, don&rsquo;t worry! Simply transfer the mixture to a baking dish before cracking the eggs into the sauce. Served with spiced pitas, this beautiful, wholesome meal is an amazingly delicious way to celebrate the closing of the season.
