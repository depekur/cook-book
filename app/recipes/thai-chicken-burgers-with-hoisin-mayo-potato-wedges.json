For incredible, authentic flavor, we&rsquo;re saut&eacute;ing aromatics&mdash;including citrusy lemongrass, an essential Thai ingredient&mdash;and mixing them into the patties. We&rsquo;re also adding sesame oil, soy sauce and sriracha (a spicy, chile-based condiment) to complete the flavor profile. Slathered onto the toasted potato buns, a spread of hoisin sauce and mayonnaise adds creamy sweetness and richness. For a light, crispy side, we&rsquo;re making homemade &ldquo;fries&rdquo; with long, hearty potato wedges, roasted in the oven.
