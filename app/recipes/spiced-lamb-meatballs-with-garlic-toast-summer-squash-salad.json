And one of their defining features is a hint of lemon. The bright citrus cuts the richness of the meatballs, perfectly balancing the dish. Here, we&rsquo;re including dried lemon peel in a blend of spices used to flavor the meatballs. And we&rsquo;re adding lemon zest and juice to a refreshing summer squash, mint and olive salad&mdash;served right on top of the meatballs, to bring the dish&rsquo;s flavors together. And to complete the meal, we&rsquo;re making crunchy, garlic baguette toasts, perfect for dipping in the sauce.
