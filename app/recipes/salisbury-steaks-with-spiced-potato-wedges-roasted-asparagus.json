Despite its name, it&rsquo;s actually a type of bunless hamburger, traditionally served in a savory brown sauce. This &ldquo;steak&rdquo; was invented by (and named for) a 19th-Century doctor, who believed that it would bolster the health of American troops. Later, the preparation was embraced by the population at large. We&rsquo;re revitalizing it here in gourmet fashion, finishing the beef patties in a mushroom sauce and adding a side of roasted asparagus and lightly spiced potato wedges.
