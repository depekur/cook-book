And we&rsquo;re ringing it in with romesco, a classic, sweet pepper-based sauce from Northeastern Spain. The sauce&mdash;also made with tomato, vinegar and almonds or hazelnuts&mdash;was originally served with seafood. But its vivid flavor has made it a favorite among chefs for a wide variety of seasonal dishes. We&rsquo;re pairing our version with succulent steaks and roasted potatoes to bring heartiness to this summer meal. For a unique spin on the sauce, we&rsquo;re using pistachios to give it an elegant, toasty richness.
