The practice originated in Cajun cuisine and is most often used for fish. But why stop there? In this dish, we&rsquo;re applying the technique to chicken: coating it in ancho chile powder (a mild spice made from dried poblano peppers) and searing it in a hot pan. This allows the spice to toast and char slightly, bringing out its flavor and creating an amazing, crispy crust. On the side, we&rsquo;re serving rice cooked with zucchini, a summer saut&eacute; of corn, cherry tomatoes and aromatics and lime-seasoned Mexican crema.
