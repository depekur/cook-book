The stir-fry is completed by a powerfully flavorful sauce, made with tangy ponzu (a citrusy, soy-based sauce), sweet chili sauce and fragrant Thai basil. The sauce clings to the ingredients, deliciously glazing them and uniting their flavors. And on the side, we&rsquo;re serving hearty, easy coconut rice, for a traditional touch of sweetness.
