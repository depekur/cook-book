A base of aromatics like chiles, galangal and makrut lime leaves combine to make the finished dish distinctly delicious. Here, we&rsquo;re taking that foundation and running with it. Our version, made with traditional tom yum paste, is tempered by the smooth richness of coconut milk. Simmering the shrimp and fresh, tender noodles in the sauce infuses them with complex, balanced flavors. Topped with fresh herbs like cilantro and Thai basil, this dish is truly the definition of yum.
