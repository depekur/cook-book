Sometimes&mdash;as in this recipe&mdash;all it takes are two deliciously contrasting ingredients to create that balance. The acidity of tomato sauce perfectly cuts the sweet richness of coconut milk. Simmered together with complex tandoori spices (including garam masala, turmeric and cardamom), they make a powerfully flavorful sauce for seared, spiced chicken and brown rice. Served on the side, a sauce of tart yogurt and fresh mint completes our unique spin on a traditional meal.
