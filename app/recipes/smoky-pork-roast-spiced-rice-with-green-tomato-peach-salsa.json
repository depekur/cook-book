Here, we&rsquo;re making a fresh, seasonally-inspired salsa featuring heirloom tomato&mdash;alongside sweet peach.

We&rsquo;re serving our salsa over succulent pork chops, rubbed with spices and seared on the stove. To complete the dish, we&rsquo;re also simmering rice together with saut&eacute;ed corn and green beans, infusing the fluffy grains with the bright flavors of the summer vegetables.
