In the U.S., the recipe usually includes cream as well, and, quite often, shrimp. We&rsquo;re using shrimp in this gourmet version (along with spring asparagus), but we&rsquo;re removing cream from the equation. Instead, we&rsquo;re substituting in light, fluffy mascarpone cheese. An Italian variety with a delightfully sweet taste, mascarpone brings this dish together with its incredible, silky texture and flavor. You&rsquo;ll never want to make fettuccine alfredo the old way again!
