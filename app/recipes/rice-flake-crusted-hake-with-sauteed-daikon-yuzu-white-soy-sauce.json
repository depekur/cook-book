Yuzu is the juice of an amazingly aromatic citrus fruit native to Eastern Asia. It&rsquo;s tart and sweet, a bright accent to any dish. We&rsquo;re combining it with light soy sauce (also called usukuchi). Though slightly bolder in flavor than its darker counterparts, it contains vinegar, making it tangier, too. This highlights the tartness of the yuzu and provides a counterpoint to its sweetness. As a sauce for rice flake-crusted hake, the combination is light, without sacrificing flavor.
