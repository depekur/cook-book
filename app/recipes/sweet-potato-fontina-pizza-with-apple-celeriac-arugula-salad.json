Then we&rsquo;re layering on sweet potato, red onion and arugula. For a seasonal side, we&rsquo;re tossing arugula with refreshing, crunchy apple and celeriac (or celery root). When peeling the celeriac, be sure to use your sturdiest, sharpest knife. &ldquo;Squaring off&rdquo; the root (or cutting off the sides to turn it into a square) both peels it and makes it easier to cut into matchsticks. Celeriac&rsquo;s uniquely delicate and crisp flavor is worth the effort!
