Our pita wraps are brimming with authentically-spiced steak, seasonal tomato, tzatziki sauce (a cooling, yogurt-based condiment) and more. And we&rsquo;re using the same spices&mdash;along with garlic paste and lemon juice&mdash;to season the butter for our corn on the cob, a deliciously summery side. Just let your butter soften enough that you can stir in the seasonings: it&rsquo;ll melt onto the freshly-boiled corn, lightly coating the sweet kernels with extra, complex flavor.
